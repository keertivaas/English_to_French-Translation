# English_to_French-Translation
Translating words in a text file from English to French using a Dictionary (CSV File)

t8.shakespeare.txt is the given text file. From this, we need to translate words from English to French, based on what's given in find_words and french_dictionary.csv, and store the translated text in t8.shakespeare.translated.txt.

We then store the no of times each word is translated for the set of words, in a frequency.csv file.

The time taken and memory used is mentioned in performance.txt
